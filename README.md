just trying my best
this is my game, it has one level. It is an html file, and runs best when opened on Microsoft Edge. You should open up the file kickingTurtles2TheGame.html. You have three lives and should use the arrow keys to control the sprite, and the down key to attack. I'm proud of my original sprite work, and hope you have fun.
